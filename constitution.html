                    <p>We, the members of The Math Club, do hereby establish this constitution in order to present our ideas and realize our purpose to its fullest extent.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE I. NAME</h3>
                    <p>The name of the organization will be "The Math Club" and will hereafter be referred to as "The Math Club."</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE II. PURPOSE</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>The Math Club is established for the purpose of fostering a greater understanding of mathematics, encouraging undergraduate activity in math research and related mathematical experiences, and providing a social and intellectual forum to all students interested in experiencing math.</p>
                    <h4>Section 2.</h4>
                    <p>The Math Club understands and is committed to fulfilling its responsibilities of abiding by University of Maryland, College Park policies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE III. MEMBERSHIP</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>All students, faculty, and staff associated with the University of Maryland are welcome to become participating members of the Math Club. All members register with the president of the club to become participating members. Only current undergraduates at the University of Maryland are eligible to become voting members, and are automatically granted voting privileges upon registration with the president.</p>
                    <h4>Section 2.</h4>
                    <p>Members may voluntarily withdraw their membership by requesting their name be removed from the registry. There are no established dues for the Math Club.</p>
                    <h4>Section 3.</h4>
                    <p>The Math Club will not discriminate against race, color, creed, sex, disability, or sexual orientation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE IV. OFFICERS</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>There are three executive positions in the Math Club: President, Vice President, and Treasurer. The President is responsible for presiding over the meetings, organizing problem sets, arranging student and faculty talks, social activities, and other general organization and PR responsibilities. The Vice President is in charge of taking minutes at meetings, updating the constitution, writing and updating the webpage, faculty/advisor correspondence, and collaborating with the president on club activities. The treasurer is the designated "SGA Liaison," and is otherwise responsible for managing the funds of the club. The faculty advisor will assist in providing problem sets as well as instigating discussion at meetings. All executive positions must be filled by undergraduates.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE V. OPERATIONS</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>Officers will be elected by voting members of the Math Club. Elections will be held at the first official meeting of the fall semester of each school year and will be in effect for the entire upcoming school year. The last official meeting of the school year will be the Monday before finals begin. No regular meetings will be held over the summer, but social and academic activities may still be arranged. Officers assume their responsibilities immediately upon election. Nominations to office will be accepted from the voting party at the beginning of each election and votes will be placed by secret ballot. Members must be present to vote. Current undergraduates in good standing with the club will be eligible for office. If an officer does not complete his duties, he may be recommended for removal at an official meeting, and then the voting party will be notified of the recommendation and his position will be voted upon at the next regular meeting by any present voting member. Removal from office requires agreement of the remaining officers, and a 2/3 majority of the present voting party.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE VI. FINANCES</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>The organization will submit a budget annually to the SGA.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE VII. AMENDMENTS</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>Amendments to the constitution may be discussed and proposed by the executive officers. They will be announced to the voting party upon proposal, and put to vote at the following regular meeting, to be voted upon only by present voting members. Voting and participating members may voice concerns about the running of the club at will, at which point the executives will discuss the concern with the faculty advisor and develop an amendment proposal which will then be put to vote as described above. Amendments will be voted upon by secret ballot.</p>

                    <h3>ARTICLE VIII. RATIFICATION</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>This constitution was last modified Aug. 28, 2020.</p>
                    
                    <h3>ARTICLE IX. REGISTRATION RENEWAL</h3>
                    <h4>Section 1.</h4>
                    <p>The Math Club will renew its registration with the Office of Campus Programs by June 9 of each year, approximately four weeks after the last official meeting of the year, when officers are elected for the upcoming school year.</p>
