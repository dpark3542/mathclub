November 29th, 4:30 pm: The Mathematics Of Sudoko! Professor Laura Taalman, James Madison University
<br><br>
Sudoku puzzles and their variants are linked to many mathematical problems 
involving combinatorics, Latin squares, magic squares, polyominos, 
symmetries, computer algorithms, the rook problem, knight tours, graph 
colorings, and permutation group theory. In this talk we will explore 
variations of Sudoku and the many open problems and new results in this 
new field of recreational mathematics. Many of the problems we will 
discuss are suitable for undergraduate research projects. Puzzle handouts 
will be available for all to enjoy!
